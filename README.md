# FlagColoring
A python adaptation of the Combinatorial Game "Flag Coloring"

When the game is started you have a selected tile, which is shown by the purple circle. The game rotates between two players, whose turn is shown by the title of the window. It is assumed that the user already knows how to play the game based on the Web version from Dr Burke.  

## Actions
You have the choice of clicking on the tile that you wish to change, or using the arrow keys to navigate between tiles.  
When you wish to make a move you press a key that corresponds to the color you wish to fill the tiles with.  
The keys are given below:  
*  'r' = Red
*  'g' = Green
*  'b' = Blue
*  'y' = Yellow
*  'w' = White
*  'k' = Black

## How To Run
To use the program you simply have to run the `main.py` file.  

## Required Libraries
* [Pygame](https://www.pygame.org/docs/) - The library used for creating the games GUI
```
pip install pygame
